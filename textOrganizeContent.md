- Concept: The Fenwick Tree, also known as the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), allows efficient computation of prefix sums and individual element updates in logarithmic time. It is a compact implementation compared to segment trees.
- Principle: Fenwick Trees use a one-dimensional array to store cumulative frequencies, leveraging binary representation for efficient access and updates. Key functions include updating values and querying prefix sums.
- Example: 
  - Code implementation of Fenwick Tree with functions for updating an element and calculating the prefix sum.
  - Range queries can be performed by combining two prefix sums.
