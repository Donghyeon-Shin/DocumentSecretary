It includes a more comprehensive understanding of how to manage connectivity queries and edge removals using a boolean segment tree. Here’s a refined version of the original answer, incorporating the new context:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "HLD(Heavy Light Decomposition)는 트리를 효율적으로 쿼리하고 업데이트하기 위한 알고리즘입니다. 이 알고리즘은 트리를 'Heavy Edge'와 'Light Edge'로 나누어 구분합니다. Heavy Edge는 부모 노드(u)와 자식 노드(v) 사이의 엣지(e)로, v의 서브트리 크기가 u의 서브트리 크기의 1/2 이상일 때 정의됩니다. 즉, 다음과 같은 조건을 만족합니다:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ \\text{Size}[v] \\geq \\frac{\\text{Size}[u]}{2} \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "이 외의 엣지는 모두 Light Edge로 간주됩니다. 서브트리 크기(Size[Node])는 해당 노드의 서브트리에 포함된 노드의 수를 의미합니다. Light Edge를 따라 올라갈 경우, 서브트리의 크기가 항상 2배 이상 증가하게 되므로, 어떤 노드에서 루트 노드로 가는 경우 최대 logN개의 Light Edge를 거치게 됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "특정 노드 u와 v가 있을 때, 이 둘을 연결하는 Light Edge는 최대 2 * logN개가 존재합니다. Edge를 각각 Heavy Edge와 Light Edge로 분리하여 이어지는 Heavy Edge를 하나의 그룹으로 보고, Light Edge는 개별적인 그룹으로써 값을 관리하면 구간의 Edge를 효율적으로 관리할 수 있습니다. 쉽게 말해, Edge를 Heavy, Light로 나누고 이어지는 Heavy는 하나의 그룹으로 보면서 Node u와 v를 잇는 Edge들을 하나하나 보는 것이 아닌 각 Edge 그룹 별로 처리하는 알고리즘입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[DFS(Depth-First Search)]]를 이용해 Edge를 Heavy Edge와 Light Edge로 나누기 때문에 O(N)의 시간 복잡도로 트리를 구성할 수 있습니다. 각각의 나누어진 Edge들은 구간 계산을 위해 [[Segment Tree]]을 이용하게 되며, O(logN)만큼의 시간복잡도가 소요됩니다. HLD의 구현은 크게 두 가지 단계로 나눌 수 있습니다:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **DFS를 이용한 서브트리 크기 계산**: Root Node부터 탐색을 시작해 각 노드들의 Sub Tree의 Size를 계산합니다.\n",
      "2. **Heavy Edge 판별 및 HLD 수행**: DFS를 한 번 사용하여 Root Node부터 탐색을 시작해 Heavy Edge를 판별하고 [[ETT(Euler Tour Technique)]]을 이용해 각 Node(또는 Edge)의 구간을 정의합니다. 구현의 편의성을 위해 Heavy Edge를 Sub Node 중 가장 Sub Tree의 크기가 큰 노드로 이어진 Edge로 정의합니다. 나누어진 Edge를 토대로 구간 계산을 진행합니다.\n",

       "\"The provided context about the Segment Tree adds valuable insight into the Heavy Light Decomposition (HLD) algorithm and its application in efficiently managing range queries and updates. Here’s a refined version of the original answer, incorporating this new context:\\n\\n---\\n\\nHLD(Heavy Light Decomposition)는 트리를 효율적으로 쿼리하고 업데이트하기 위한 알고리즘입니다. 이 알고리즘은 트리를 'Heavy Edge'와 'Light Edge'로 나누어 구분합니다. Heavy Edge는 부모 노드(u)와 자식 노드(v) 사이의 엣지(e)로, v의 서브트리 크기가 u의 서브트리 크기의 1/2 이상일 때 정의됩니다. 즉, 다음과 같은 조건을 만족합니다:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Size}[v] \\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\text{Size}[u]}{2} \\\\]\\n\\n이 외의 엣지는 모두 Light Edge로 간주됩니다. 서브트리 크기(Size[Node])는 해당 노드의 서브트리에 포함된 노드의 수를 의미합니다. Light Edge를 따라 올라갈 경우, 서브트리의 크기가 항상 2배 이상 증가하게 되므로, 어떤 노드에서 루트 노드로 가는 경우 최대 logN개의 Light Edge를 거치게 됩니다.\\n\\n특정 노드 u와 v가 있을 때, 이 둘을 연결하는 Light Edge는 최대 2 * logN개가 존재합니다. Edge를 각각 Heavy Edge와 Light Edge로 분리하여 이어지는 Heavy Edge를 하나의 그룹으로 보고, Light Edge는 개별적인 그룹으로써 값을 관리하면 구간의 Edge를 효율적으로 관리할 수 있습니다. 쉽게 말해, Edge를 Heavy, Light로 나누고 이어지는 Heavy는 하나의 그룹으로 보면서 Node u와 v를 잇는 Edge들을 하나하나 보는 것이 아닌 각 Edge 그룹 별로 처리하는 알고리즘입니다.\\n\\n[[DFS(Depth-First Search)]]를 이용해 Edge를 Heavy Edge와 Light Edge로 나누기 때문에 O(N)의 시간 복잡도로 트리를 구성할 수 있습니다. DFS는 임의의 노드에서 시작하여 해당 노드의 모든 자식 노드를 재귀적으로 탐색하는 방법으로, 각 Branch를 완벽하게 탐색한 후 다음 Branch로 넘어갑니다. 이 과정에서 Visited Array를 사용하여 중복 탐색을 방지합니다. 노드의 개수 n, 간선의 개수 e일 때 DFS의 시간 복잡도는 O(n + e)입니다.\\n\\nDFS의 재귀 호출 과정에서, 예를 들어 Node 5가 호출되면, 그 다음 재귀를 통해 Node 4로 돌아가 오른쪽 Branch에 있는 Node 6을 탐색합니다. Node 6은 다음 Branch가 없기 때문에 다른 Branch가 있는 Node 1번까지 올라가 Node 3을 탐색하게 됩니다. 이러한 방식은 더 이상 탐색할 수 없을 때까지 반복됩니다. 이 과정을 시각적으로 이해하기 위해 Recursion 순서도로 표현할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n각각의 나누어진 Edge들은 구간 계산을 위해 [[Segment Tree]]을 이용하게 되며, O(logN)만큼의 시간복잡도가 소요됩니다. Segment Tree는 배열의 범위를 가진 이진 트리 구조의 일종으로, 배열의 구간 합, 차, 곱을 빠르게 계산할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 배열의 길이를 N이라 하고 쿼리(구간 연산을 계산하는 횟수)를 M이라고 할 때, Segment Tree를 사용하면 O(logN)의 시간복잡도로 구간 연산을 수행할 수 있습니다.\\n\\nSegment Tree의 구현에서 주의할 점은 노드의 인덱스가 1부터 시작하는 경우가 많다는 것입니다. 이는 Segment Tree의 루트 인덱스를 1로 설정할 경우, 노드의 왼쪽 자식 인덱스는 node * 2, 오른쪽 자식 인덱스는 node * 2 + 1로 쉽게 계산할 수 있기 때문입니다. Segment Tree에 필요한 기능은 크게 세 가지가 있습니다: \\n\\n1. **init()**: 배열에 있는 값들을 범위에 맞춰 Segment Tree에 넣습니다.\\n2. **update()**: 배열 값에 변화가 있는 경우 이에 맞춰 Segment Tree 값을 바꿉니다.\\n3. **calculation()**: 배열 범위에 맞는 값을 Segment Tree에서 찾아 연산해 Return 합니다.\\n\\nSegment Tree의 구조는 트리 높이가 log2(n)이고, 트리 크기는 (트리 높이 + 1) ^ 2입니다. Parameter start와 end는 각각 배열 범위의 시작과 끝을 의미하며, start == end는 leaf Node를 의미하고 해당 범위의 값은 array[start]입니다. 루트 노드에서 시작해 다음 두 child 범위는 child_One : start ~ (start + end) / 2, child_Two : (start + end) / 2 + 1 ~ end입니다. 배열에 범위(left~right)에 맞는 Segment Tree Node는 left <= start && end <= right입니다. 만약 end < left || right < start라면 해당 Node가 범위에 포함되지 않기 때문에 return 0을 합니다.\\n\\nHLD의 구현은 크게 두 가지 단계로 나눌 수 있습니다:\\n\\n1. **DFS를 이용한 서브트리 크기 계산**: Root Node부터 탐색을 시작해 각 노드들의 Sub Tree의 Size를 계산합니다.\\n2. **Heavy Edge 판별 및 HLD 수행**: DFS를 한 번 사용하여 Root Node부터 탐색을 시작해 Heavy Edge를 판별하고 [[ETT(Euler Tour Technique)]]을 이용해 각 Node(또는 Edge)의 구간을 정의합니다. ETT는 Root Node에서 시작해 방문 번호(cnt)를 매기면서 DFS를 진행하여 각 노드의 진입 방문 번호(s[node])와 탈출 방문 번호(e[node])를 기록합니다. s[node]는 해당 Node가 방문된 번호이고, e[node]는 해당 Node의 자식들 중 가장 방문 번호가 늦은 번호입니다. 이러한 정보를 통해 모든 Node를 탐색하고 얻은 s, e가 해당 Node의 구간을 정의합니다. DFS만 알고 있다면 이해하는 데 어렵지 않은 알고리즘입니다.\\n\\n주어진 예제 입력에 대한 트리 구조는 다음과 같습니다:\\n\\n```\\n9\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n4 5\\n4 6\\n3 7\\n3 8\\n8 9\\n8 10\\n```\\n\\n이 트리는 1번 노드를 루트로 하여 2번과 3번 노드가 자식 노드로 연결되어 있으며, 2번 노드는 4번 노드와 연결되고, 4번 노드는 5번과 6번 노드와 연결됩니다. 3번 노드는 7번과 8번 노드와 연결되며, 8번 노드는 9번과 10번 노드와 연결됩니다. 이러한 구조를 통해 HLD를 적용하면 각 쿼리와 업데이트를 효율적으로 처리할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n아래는 HLD의 예제 코드입니다:\\n\\n```python\\nclass HLD:\\n    def __init__(self, n):\\n        self.n = n\\n        self.tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]\\n        self.size = [0] * n\\n        self.parent = [-1] * n\\n        self.depth = [0] * n\\n        self.chain_head = [-1] * n\\n        self.chain_index = [-1] * n\\n        self.chain_size = []\\n        self.current_chain = 0\\n\\n    def add_edge(self, u, v):\\n        self.tree[u].append(v)\\n        self.tree[v].append(u)\\n\\n    def dfs(self, node, par):\\n        self.size[node] = 1\\n        self.parent[node] = par\\n        for neighbor in self.tree[node]:\\n            if neighbor != par:\\n                self.depth[neighbor] = self.depth[node] + 1\\n                self.size[node] += self.dfs(neighbor, node)\\n        return self.size[node]\\n\\n    def hld(self, node):\\n        if self.chain_head[self.current_chain] == -1:\\n            self.chain_head[self.current_chain] = node\\n        self.chain_index[node] = len(self.chain_size)\\n        self.chain_size.append(node)\\n\\n        heavy_child = -1\\n        max_size = 0\\n        for neighbor in self.tree[node]:\\n            if neighbor != self.parent[node] and self.size[neighbor] > max_size:\\n                max_size = self.size[neighbor]\\n                heavy_child = neighbor\\n\\n        if heavy_child != -1:\\n            self.hld(heavy_child)\\n\\n        for neighbor in self.tree[node]:\\n            if neighbor != self.parent[node] and neighbor != heavy_child:\\n                self.current_chain += 1\\n                self.hld(neighbor)\\n\\n    def build(self, root):\\n        self.dfs(root, -1)\\n        self.hld(root)\\n\\n# Example usage\\nhld = HLD(11)  # Example Input: 11\\nhld.add_edge(0, 1)\\nhld.add_edge(0, 2)\\nhld.add_edge(1, 3)\\nhld.add_edge(1, 4)\\nhld.add_edge(2, 5)\\nhld.add_edge(3, 6)\\nhld.add_edge(3, 7)\\nhld.add_edge(7, 8)\\nhld.add_edge(8, 9)\\nhld.add_edge(8, 10)\\nhld.build(0)\\n```\\n\\n이 코드는 HLD를 구현한 기본적인 예제입니다. 트리를 구성하고 HLD를 통해 Heavy Light Decomposition을 수행하는 과정을 보여줍니다.\\n\\n구간을 고려하여 구간 계산을 진행할 수 있으며, [[LCA(Lowest Common Ancestor)]]로도 구현 가능하나, 개인적으로 코드가 복잡해 선호하진 않습니다. HLD를 구현하기 위해서는 [[DFS(Depth-First Search)]], [[ETT(Euler Tour Technique)]], [[Segment Tree]]를 선행으로 알고 있어야 하기 때문에 난이도가 있는 알고리즘입니다. 코드를 보고 Debug 과정을 손으로 그리면서 생각해보는 것이 이해하는 데 많은 도움이 될 것입니다.\\n\\n추가적으로, DFS를 하는 과정에서 Parent의 정보를 기록해 놓으면 후에 ETT를 계산하는 과정이나 Light Edge를 건너는 과정에서 활용할 수 있습니다. 그룹(구간)의 편의성을 위해 Heavy Edge를 Edge Vector 맨 앞으로 위치 시키면 ETT를 계산하는 과정에서 Heavy Edge의 번호가 연속성을 가지게 되어 Segment Tree를 활용할 수 있게 됩니다.\\n\\n또한, `head[node]`는 같은 그룹의 가장 Depth가 낮은 노드를 나타내며, Edge를 건너는 과정에서 활용됩니다. ETT를 구하는 과정에서 함께 구해야 하며, 초기에는 `head[Root Node]`를 전체 Tree의 Root Node로 초기화해야 합니다.\\n\\n주어진 예제 입력에 대한 출력은 다음과 같습니다:\\n\\n```\\nNode 1 : 1 8\\nNode 2 : 2 2\\nNode 3 : 3 4\\nNode 4 : 5 8\\nNode 5 : 4 4\\nNode 6 : 6 6\\nNode 7 : 7 8\\nNode 8 : 8 8\\n```\\n\\n이와 같이 HLD를 통해 트리의 쿼리를 효율적으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 추가적으로, HLD를 활용한 응용 문제에서는 Segment Tree를 사용하여 두 노드 사이를 연결하는 Edge가 존재하는지 판단할 수 있습니다. 모든 간선이 연결되어 있기 때문에 처음 Segment Tree는 모두 1(True)로 초기화하고, Edge를 제거할 때는 해당 Edge의 번호를 0으로 업데이트하면 됩니다. 두 노드의 구간에 대해 Segment Tree의 값이 1이면 두 노드를 잇는 Edge가 존재하는 것이고, 0이면 없는 것입니다.\\n\\n특히, 각 노드의 깊이(depth[node])를 기록함으로써 물의 양을 계산하는 쿼리에서도 활용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 특정 노드에 물을 넣을 때 Segment Tree로 그 노드의 방문 횟수를 기록한 뒤, 물의 양을 구하는 쿼리에서는 해당 노드의 모든 자식 도시들의 방문 수에 깊이를 곱하여 계산할 수 있습니다. 물의 값이 int 범위를 초과할 수 있으므로 long long 자료형을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\\n\\nC++로 구현된 HLD의 예제는 다음과 같습니다:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n#include <cmath>\\n#define MAX_SIZE 100001\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint n, m, u[MAX_SIZE], v[MAX_SIZE], w[MAX_SIZE];\\nint parent[MAX_SIZE] = {0, }, subTreeSize[MAX_SIZE] = {0, }, s[MAX_SIZE], e[MAX_SIZE], head[MAX_SIZE], range_Cnt = 0;\\nvector<int> adj[MAX_SIZE], segment_Tree;\\n\\nint calcul_SubTreeSize(int node) {\\n    subTreeSize[node] = 1;\\n    for (int& nNode : adj[node]) {\\n        if (nNode == parent[node]) continue;\\n        parent[nNode] = node;\\n        subTreeSize[node] += calcul_SubTreeSize(nNode);\\n        int& maximumSubTreeNode = adj[node][0]; // 서브트리가 가장 큰 자식을 맨 앞으로 옮김\\n        if (maximumSubTreeNode == parent[node] || subTreeSize[maximumSubTreeNode] < subTreeSize[nNode])\\n            swap(maximumSubTreeNode, nNode);\\n    }\\n    return subTreeSize[node];\\n}\\n\\nvoid hld(int node) {\\n    s[node] = ++range_Cnt;\\n    for (int& nNode : adj[node]) {\\n        if (nNode == parent[node]) continue;\\n        head[nNode] = (nNode == adj[node][0]) ? head[node] : nNode; // 무거운 경로에 해당하면 head로 같이 묶고 아니면 가벼운 간선으로 만듦\\n        hld(nNode);\\n    }\\n    e[node] = range_Cnt;\\n}\\n\\nvoid update(int node, int start, int end, int target, int val) {\\n    if (end < target || target < start) return;\\n    if (start == end) {\\n        segment_Tree[node] = val;\\n        return;\\n    }\\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\\n    update(node * 2, start, mid, target, val);\\n    update(node * 2 + 1, mid + 1, end, target, val);\\n    segment_Tree[node] = max(segment_Tree[node * 2], segment_Tree[node * 2 + 1]);\\n}\\n\\nint calcul_MaximumEdgeWeight(int node, int start, int end, int left, int right) {\\n    if (end < left || right < start) return 0;\\n    if (left <= start && end <= right) return segment_Tree[node];\\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\\n    return max(calcul_MaximumEdgeWeight(node * 2, start, mid, left, right), \\n               calcul_MaximumEdgeWeight(node * 2 + 1, mid + 1, end, left, right));\\n}\\n\\nint query(int n1, int n2) {\\n    int result = 0;\\n    while (head[n1] != head[n2]) {\\n        if (subTreeSize[head[n1]] < subTreeSize[head[n2]]) swap(n1, n2);\\n        result = max(result, calcul_MaximumEdgeWeight(1, 1, n, s[head[n2]], s[n2]));\\n        n2 = parent[head[n2]];\\n    }\\n    if (s[n1] > s[n2]) swap(n1, n2);\\n    result = max(result, calcul_MaximumEdgeWeight(1, 1, n, s[n1] + 1, s[n2]));\\n    return result;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\\n    cin.tie(NULL);\\n    cout.tie(NULL);\\n    cin >> n;\\n    int height = int(ceil(log2(n)));\\n    int tree_Size = (1 << (height + 1));\\n    segment_Tree.resize(tree_Size);\\n\\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n        cin >> u[i] >> v[i] >> w[i];\\n        adj[u[i]].push_back(v[i]);\\n        adj[v[i]].push_back(u[i]);\\n    }\\n\\n    head[1] = 1; // head init of Root Node\\n    calcul_SubTreeSize(1);\\n    hld(1);\\n\\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n        if (parent[u[i]] == v[i]) swap(u[i], v[i]);\\n        update(1, 1, n, s[v[i]], w[i]);\\n    }\\n\\n    cin >> m;\\n    while (m--) {\\n        int q, a, b;\\n        cin >> q >> a >> b;\\n        if (q == 1) {\\n            if (parent[u[a]] == v[a]) swap(u[a], v[a]);\\n            update(1, 1, n, s[v[a]], b);\\n        } else {\\n            cout << query(a, b) << '\\\\n';\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n이 C++ 코드는 HLD를 구현한 예제로, 엣지 가중치를 업데이트하고 트리를 쿼리하는 방법을 보여줍니다. HLD와 Segment Tree를 결합하여 트리 쿼리를 효율적으로 처리하는 방법을 설명합니다.\\n\\n이러한 추가적인 맥락은 HLD 알고리즘의 이해를 더욱 깊게 해주며, 트리 구조의 특성을 활용하여 효율적인 쿼리 및 업데이트를 가능하게 합니다. 특히, DP를 통해 이미 확인한 경로의 경우는 다시 탐색하는 것이 아니라 이미 계산했던 값을 가져와 중복 탐색을 방지하는 점은 HLD의 효율성을 더욱 높이는 중요한 요소입니다.\""
