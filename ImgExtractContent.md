Given the context and actions taken, my current status indicates that the extraction of image content is hindered due to access issues. I have delegated the task to my coworker to extract the text from the relevant image files related to the Fenwick Tree, ensuring they understand to extract all content in Korean without modification.

Currently, the specific files needing extraction are:

1. **Fenwick Tree Struct Graph**: Located at `./Algorithm/Algorithm Content/Tree/Fenwick Tree Struct Graph.svg`
2. **Fenwick Tree Partial Sum Graph**: Located at `./Algorithm/Algorithm Content/Tree/Fenwick Tree Partial Sum Graph.svg`
3. **Fenwick Tree Range Update & Point Query Graph**: Located at `./Algorithm/Algorithm Content/Tree/Fenwick Tree Range Update & Point Query Graph.svg`

However, the direct content of these images is currently inaccessible. Once my coworker reports back on the status of that extraction, or if I get access to the files, I will finalize the outputs with the actual extracted texts.

Hence, this is an incomplete state regarding the direct contents from the specified images until further details are confirmed.
